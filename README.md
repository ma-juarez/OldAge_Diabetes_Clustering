# Type 2 diabetes clustering above 65 years
My Bachelor's Thesis consisted of analysing different molecular markers such as protein levels of PEDF in plasma, as well as genotyping of different genes such as SUGP1 or TCF7L2 in blood samples of type 2 diabetes patients above 65 years of age. For the analysis of the results different models were used, including multiple regression analysis to take into account the effect of medication. 

Furthermore, to complete the analysis, the different measured markers were mixed with other factors involved in type 2 diabetes such as IBM, blood pressure and other factors to build  a clustering method based on [Ahlqvist et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30051-2) This method managed to cluster the type 2 diabetes population above 65 years of age in two different groups based on the severity of the disease.
